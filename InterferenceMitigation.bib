  abstract      = {In autonomous driving, radar systems play an important role in detecting targets such as other vehicles on the road. Radars mounted on different cars can interfere with each other, degrading the detection performance. Deep learning methods for automotive radar interference mitigation can succesfully estimate the amplitude of targets, but fail to recover the phase of the respective targets. In this paper, we propose an efficient and effective technique based on unfolded robust Principal Component Analysis (RPCA) that is able to estimate both amplitude and phase in the presence of interference. Our contribution consists in introducing residual overcomplete auto-encoder (ROC-AE) blocks into the recurrent architecture of unfolded RPCA, which results in a deeper model that significantly outperforms unfolded RPCA as well as other deep learning models.},

  abstract      = {A prior-guided deep learning (DL) based interference mitigation approach is proposed for frequency modulated continuous wave (FMCW) radars. In this paper, the interference mitigation problem is tackled as a regression problem. Considering the complex-valued nature of radar signals, the complex-valued convolutional neural network is utilized as an architecture for implementation, which is different from the conventional real-valued counterparts. Meanwhile, as the useful beat signals of FMCW radars and interferences exhibit different distributions in the time-frequency domain, this prior feature is exploited as a regularization term to avoid overfitting of the learned representation. The effectiveness and accuracy of our proposed complex-valued fully convolutional network (CV-FCN) based interference mitigation approach are verified and analyzed through both simulated and measured radar signals. Compared to the real-valued counterparts, the CV-FCN shows a better interference mitigation performance with a potential of half memory reduction in low Signal to Interference plus Noise Ratio (SINR) scenarios. Moreover, the CV-FCN trained using only simulated data can be directly utilized for interference mitigation in various measured radar signals and shows a superior generalization capability. Furthermore, by incorporating the prior feature, the CV-FCN trained on only 1/8 of the full data achieves comparable performance as that on the full dataset in low SINR scenarios, and the training procedure converges faster.},

  abstract      = {In light of the finite nature of the wireless spectrum and the increasing demand for spectrum use arising from recent technological breakthroughs in wireless communication, the problem of interference continues to persist. Despite recent advancements in resolving interference issues, interference still presents a difficult challenge to effective usage of the spectrum. This is partly due to the rise in the use of license-free and managed shared bands for Wi-Fi, long term evolution (LTE) unlicensed (LTE-U), LTE licensed assisted access (LAA), 5G NR, and other opportunistic spectrum access solutions. As a result of this, the need for efficient spectrum usage schemes that are robust against interference has never been more important. In the past, most solutions to interference have addressed the problem by using avoidance techniques as well as non-AI mitigation approaches (for example, adaptive filters). The key downside to non-AI techniques is the need for domain expertise in the extraction or exploitation of signal features such as cyclostationarity, bandwidth and modulation of the interfering signals. More recently, researchers have successfully explored AI/ML enabled physical (PHY) layer techniques, especially deep learning which reduces or compensates for the interfering signal instead of simply avoiding it. The underlying idea of ML based approaches is to learn the interference or the interference characteristics from the data, thereby sidelining the need for domain expertise in suppressing the interference. In this paper, we review a wide range of techniques that have used deep learning to suppress interference. We provide comparison and guidelines for many different types of deep learning techniques in interference suppression. In addition, we highlight challenges and potential future research directions for the successful adoption of deep learning in interference suppression.},
